                <h1>  Introduction to Biology
        </h1>
        <p> Biology is the natural science that studies life and living organisms, including their physical structure, chemical processes, molecular interactions, physiological mechanisms, development and evolution.
        Despite the complexity of the science, there are certain unifying concepts that consolidate it into a single, coherent field.
        </p>   
        <p>Biology recognizes the cell as the basic unit of life, genes as the basic unit of heredity, and evolution as the engine that propels the creation and extinction of species. 
        Living organisms are open systems that survive by transforming energy and decreasing their local entropy to maintain a stable and vital condition defined as homeostasis.
        </p>

        <p>Sub-disciplines of biology are defined by the research methods employed and the kind of system studied.
        </p> 
        <p><h3>Branches of Biology</h3>
        </p>
        <ol> <li>Anatomy: the study of organisms structure.

<h2>Cell structure</h2>
<p>The <q><b>cell</b></q> is the basic structural, functional, and biological unit of all known living organisms. A cell is the smallest unit of life. Cells are often called the "building blocks of life". <p> The study of cells is called cell biology or cellular biology.
Cells consist of cytoplasm enclosed within a membrane, which contains many biomolecules such as proteins and nucleic acids. Organisms can be classified as unicellular (consisting of a single cell; including bacteria) or multicellular (including plants and animals)</p>

<p> Living organisms are complex systems organised in a hierarchical manner from organic macromolecules and genes to cells, cells to tissues, organs and whole organisms. Biology attempts to provide, through the study of the diverse array of organisms such as bacteria, fungi, plants and animals, a scientific approach to the understanding of living systems, or life. Although the roots of biology can be traced back to the ancient Greeks, biology as we know it today came about during the nineteenth century through the development in several major fields of study. Broadly speaking, modern biology is based on the concepts of cell theory, embryology, homeostasis, evolutionary theory and genetics.

<p> The late 1980s saw the convergence of different fields of study in biology as well as information technology into what is known as Bioinformatics. These different areas include molecular biology, genetics, genomics, biochemistry as well as evolutionary biology and computational technologies. It is hoped that with the help of Bioinformatics, the understanding of biology can be attained at a faster speed and with a more global perspective as we look for unifying principles governing life across the evolutionary divide. As the underpinnings of Bioinformatics stems from different areas of biology, the Introductory Biology course aims to provide an insight into the fundamental principles of life, drawing from the knowledge gleaned from studies in molecular biology, genetics, cell biology and evolutionary biology.

Provide an overview of the diversity and unity of life.
